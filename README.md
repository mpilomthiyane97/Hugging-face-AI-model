# Overview
Roberta base for QA is a model that can be used to ask and answer questions based on context. Let's create a trivia game with that!

# Instructions
- Go to [this page](https://huggingface.co/deepset/roberta-base-squad2) and read about roberta base for QA. Understand this model and what it does. You can utilize the inference API on the right to test things out.
- With the premade context found below, create a python trivia game where you test whether this model can answer your questions about the different contexts.
- The user should be able to do the following:
  - Choose the genre they want. You should be able to get all the list of genres from the provided array.
  - Give the user the ability to choose one of the already available questions, or simply ask their own questions.
  - After a question is asked, check the answer. Does it provide correct answers? We have added expected answers, to make it easier for you to compare. 
  - Document the models responses, does it return the correct answer? If yes, give it a score of one, otherwise give it a 0.
- Add more trivia questions.
- At the end look at the final results, how did the model perform?
- What could this model be useful for? Discuss that between you.

The wall is made of various materials, including stone, brick, tamped earth, and wood.",

This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells and involves the absorption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water from the soil.
